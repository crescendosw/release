verse      How  sweet the name    of    Je  -  sus   sounds  In   a       be - liev -  er's  ear!
verse      It   makes the wound - ed    spir - it    whole   And  calms   the  trou -  bled  breast;
verse      Dear Name, the Rock    on    which  I     build,  My   Shield  and  Hid  -  ing   Place,
verse      By   Thee  my  prayers ac  - cep -  tance gain,   Al - though  with sin     de -  filed;
verse      Je - sus!  my  Shep -  herd, Hus -  band, Friend, My   Proph - et,  Priest, and   King,
verse      Weak is    the ef   -  fort  of     my    heart,  And  cold    my   warm  - est   thought;
verse      Till then  I   would   Thy   love   pro - claim   With ev   -  'ry  fleet - ing   breath;

verse      It   soothes his  sor -  rows, heals   his  wounds, And  drives  a -  way    his fear.
verse      'Tis man  -  na   to     the   hun  -  gry  soul,   And  to      the  wear - y,  rest.
verse      My   nev  -  er - fail - ing   treas - 'ry, filled  With bound - less stores of  grace!
verse      Sa - tan     ac - cus  - es    me      in   vain,   And  I       am   owned  a   child.
verse      My   Lord,   my   Life,  my    Way,    my   End,    Ac - cept    the  praise I   bring.
verse      But  when    I    see    Thee  as      Thou are,    I'll praise  Thee as     I   ought.
verse      And  may     the  mu  -  sic   of      Thy  Name    Re - fresh   my   soul   in  death!
